    "## NOTE:\n",
    "- Ensure all required Python libraries are installed before running the script.\n",
    "- Required libraries include: requests, pandas, beautifulsoup4.\n",
    "- You can install them via pip if needed:\n",
    "- pip install requests pandas beautifulsoup4\n",
    "- You can run the script as-is if all libraries are installed correctly.\n",
    "- Before running, verify the **years** and **countries** for which you want to fetch holiday data.\n",
    "- In the code, there is a list called **country_codes = ['australia']**.\n",
    "- You can add or remove countries in this list based on your requirements.\n",
    "- The year range is controlled by the loop:\n",
    "- **for year in range(2024, 2041):**\n",
    "- You can adjust the start and end years here.\n",
    "- For example, to get holiday data up to 2040, set the range to range(2024, 2041) — note the end year is exclusive, so you add 1 to include 2040.\n",
    "- The output CSV files should have a **consistent naming format**, e.g., Holidays_.\n",
    "- This consistency helps later when consolidating all files into a single file containing data from all countries.\n",
    "- In the workflow, different code cells have different countries listed, but the code structure remains the same.\n",
    "- This approach is designed so that scraping runs faster and avoids overloading the server.\n",
    "- Ensure you have a stable internet connection during execution as the script fetches live data.\n",
    "- The script includes a delay (time.sleep(2)) between requests to be respectful of the website and avoid rate limiting.\n",
    "- Before consloidating the file, make sure all excel files are in one folder"
