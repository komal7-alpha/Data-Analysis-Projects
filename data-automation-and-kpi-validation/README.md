# Data Automation and KPI Validation

# Data Automation and KPI Validation

## Project Overview
This project represents a real-world data automation and KPI validation workflow aligned with my current role as a Data Analyst.

The focus of this project is on automating manual data processes, improving data accuracy, and supporting forecasting datasets for business reporting in a production-style environment.

---

## Business Problem
Manual data processing and KPI validation created multiple operational challenges:

- High manual effort  
- Data quality issues  
- Forecast inconsistencies  
- Delays in reporting  

---

## Solution Approach
The solution was designed using Python, PySpark, SQL Server, and Power BI to automate and validate end-to-end data workflows:

- Automated ingestion of Excel-based inputs and externally scraped data  
- Applied data cleaning, standardization, and validation logic using Python  
- Performed data quality checks and rolling 12-week outlier detection to support forecasting datasets  
- Leveraged PySpark for large-volume data processing and reliable data loading into SQL Server, avoiding memory limitations  
- Implemented business KPI validation rules using SQL queries and stored procedures  
- Enabled downstream reporting and analysis through Power BI dashboards

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- PySpark  
- SQL Server  
- Excel  
- Power BI  

---

## Key Outcomes
- Reduced manual data processing effort by approximately 70%  
- Improved overall data accuracy by around 30%  
- Reduced forecast inconsistencies by nearly 20%  

---

## Notes
This repository follows a production-style structure with modular ETL components, scalable data processing, and a clear separation between ingestion, validation, and reporting layers.
