# Data Automation and KPI Validation

## Project Overview

This project represents a real-world data automation and KPI validation workflow
similar to my current role as a Data Analyst.

The focus of this project is on automating manual data processes,
improving data accuracy, and supporting forecasting datasets for business reporting.


## Business Problem

Manual data processing and KPI validation created:
- High manual effort
- Data quality issues
- Forecast inconsistencies
- Delays in reporting


## Solution Approach

The solution was designed using Python and SQL to automate and validate data workflows:

- Built Python-based ETL pipelines to process Excel files and load clean data into SQL Server
- Performed data quality checks and rolling 12-week outlier detection for forecasting datasets
- Automated data ingestion using Python-based web scraping across multiple regions
- Implemented business KPI validation rules using SQL queries and stored-procedure logic


## Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- SQL (SQL Server)
- Excel
- Power BI (for reporting support)


## Key Outcomes

- Reduced manual data processing effort by approximately 70%
- Improved data accuracy by around 30%
- Reduced forecast inconsistencies by nearly 20%
